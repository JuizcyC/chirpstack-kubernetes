# Chirpstack kubernetes
This repository contains a skeleton to deploy the ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack on a kubernetes cluster.

**Note**: We used this docker-compose.yml file as a starting point for testing but keep in mind that for production usage it might need modifications. then we created kubernetes configurations files using [kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose), after that we've done some modifications on these files
